print('Once upon a time, on the edge of the forest, there was a door that appeared only at sunrise. 
Everyone knew it led somewhere, but no one dared open it-except for Matteo. 
One morning, he stepped through, finding himself in a world where shadows walked like people and sunlight sang in whispers. 
By dusk, the door was gone, and Matteo had become one of the shadows, forever wandering between light and dark.')
